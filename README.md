# Snake Game
This is the game Snake made in Java. I made it last December. It's the definition of rough and likely inefficient code, but I learned a lot.
My personal record is a score of 512.

## Instructions
- Use the arrow keys, or WASD, to control the head of the snake.
- Increase the length of your snake by eating the red food.
- The head of your snake should avoid hitting itself, a white barrier, or the walls.
- Get the highest score possible. I consider scoring 300 or more to be a winning score.
- Barriers can make things get hectic, quick. So play carefully!
- As time goes on, your score decreases. So play quickly!

## Requirements
- Java 10

#### Known bugs:
- Pressing multiple keys in the same frame can cause unexpected behavior. Indeed, this is a feature.
- White barriers appear during gameplay. It is possible for the red food to get trapped behind barriers. Again, intended behavior.
- Snake dots are *just* off-center when drawn. Or the barriers/food are. Either way, it is no big deal.
